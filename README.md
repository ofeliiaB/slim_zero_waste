  - Create .htaccess file in the public directory for Apache Server. The content of the file shall be: 
  >RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
  - Configure the web server's document/web root to be the public directory
  - The index.php should be in the root folder of the project (www root).

 >AllowOverride All

 > $app = new \Slim\App([
  'settings' => [
    'displayErrorDetails' => true,
    'db' => [
      'driver' => 'mysql',
      'host' => '127.0.0.1',
